<h1>Introducing PBON</h1>

<p>PBON (Portable Binary Object Notation) is a light-weight binary data interchange format 
inspired by <a href="https://json.org">JSON</a>.</p>

<p>PBON is built on the same structures as JSON, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>A collection of key/value pairs (realized as an <em>object</em> in some programming languages)</li>
<li>An ordered list of values (realized as an <em>array</em> in some programming languages)</li>
</ul>

<p>The primary difference between JSON and PBON is that PBON is a more compact format that allows binary 
data (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> strings) to be represented 
directly in the encoding without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character">escaping</a>.
The trade-off is that PBON loses some human-readability to achieve this compactness.</p>

<p>PBON prefers the simplicity of JSON over implementing the most compact binary representation possible, 
in order to maintain some human-readability and to make implementation straightforward.</p>

<p>PBON supports backward compatibility by enabling implementations to skip values with unrecognized keys, 
for example, key/value pairs added as part of a newer version of an object.</p>

<p>In PBON, an <em>object</em> is an unordered set of key/value pairs. An object begins with a 
left brace { and ends with a right brace }.</p>

<div class="figure"><div>object</div><img src="/images/object.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>A <em>key</em> is a positive integer encoded as a variable-length integer.</p>

<!--<p>A <em>variable-length integer</em> is a base-128 encoded integer in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> octet order,
with a continuation bit set in the most significant (7th) bit for all but the last octet (see 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity">variable-length quantity</a> 
for an example). Negative values are stored as the one's-complement of the value with the 
sign in the 2nd most significant (6th) binary digit of the first octet.</p>-->

<p>An <em>array</em> is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with a 
left bracket [ and ends with a right  bracket ].</p>

<div class="figure"><div>array</div><img src="/images/array.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>A <em>value</em> can be binary, a string, an integer, a float, an object, an array, 
true (t) or false (f) or null (~).</p>

<div class="figure"><div>value</div><img src="/images/value.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>A <em>binary</em> value is a length-prefixed sequence of bytes.</p>

<p>A <em>length-prefix</em> is a non-negative integer value, encoded as variable-length integer.</p>

<p>A <em>string</em> is a length-prefixed sequence of <a href="https://www.utf-8.com/">UTF-8</a> encoded characters.</p>

<p>An <em>integer</em> is a length-prefixed base-256 encoded value in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> 
order. Negative integer values are stored using the bitwise complement of the negative value with the most significant bit 
(the sign bit) set to 1.</p>

<p>A <em>float</em> is a length-prefixed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008">IEEE 754</a> encoded 
floating point value in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> order.</p>

<h2>Variable-length integer</h2>

<p>A <em>variable-length integer</em> is stored as an initial byte followed by one or more trailing bytes.</p>

<p>The most-significant bit of each byte (C) is a continuation indicator, which is set to 1 for all but the last byte.</p>

<p>The second most-significant bit of the first byte (S) is reserved as the sign indicator, which is set to 1 for negative values.</p>

<!-- <p><em>Note that this makes it possible to determine the sign of a variable-length value by checking only the first byte of the value,
which can be helpful when reading from a stream.</em></p>-->

<p>The remaining bits (Vn) contain the value in big-endian byte order (most significant digits first).</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="/images/varint.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Negative values are transformed using a bitwise complement operation before encoding.
This ensures that small negative numbers will also occupy a small amount of encoded space.</p>

<p>For example, here's the value 1. It's a single byte so the continuation bit (C) is not set, 
and it's a positive value so the sign bit (S) is not set:</p>

<pre>
<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">00</span>00 0001
</pre>

<p>And here's the value 300:</p>

<pre>
1000 0010 0010 1100
</pre>

<p>To calculate this value, start with the binary encoding of 300 and split it into 7-bit groups 
starting from the least-significant digit:</p>

<pre>
300 → 10 0101100
</pre>

<p>And finally, set the sign bit (S) to 0 to indicate a positive value and the continuation bit of each byte (C) except the last to 1:</p>

<pre>
→ <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">10</span>000010 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">0</span>0101100
</pre>

<p>Here's the value -300:</p>

<pre>
1100 0010 0010 1011
</pre>

<p>To encode a negative number, start with the binary encoding of the value, take the bitwise complement,
and split it into 7-bit groups starting from the least-significant digit:</p>

<pre>
   -300 → 1111 1110 1101 0100
~(-300) →         1 0010 1011
        →          10 0101011
</pre>

<p>And finally, set the sign bit (S) to 1 to indicate a negative value and the continuation bit of each byte (C) except the last to 1:</p>

<pre>
→ <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">11</span>000010 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">0</span>0101011
</pre>

<h2>A complete example</h2>

<p>Let's start with the following simple message:</p>

<pre>
class Message1
{
    string Name = "Foo";
}
</pre>

<p>This message would be encoded as the following bytes:</p>

<pre>
7B 01 03 46 6F 6F 7D
</pre>

<p>Let's break this down:</p>

<p>The first and last bytes (7B ... 7D) are the braces { } that surround every object.</p>

<p>The second byte (01) is the first member key (1) encoded as a variable-length integer.</p>

<p>The third byte (03) is the length of the string member value to follow (3 bytes), also encoded as a variable-length integer.</p>

<p>And finally, bytes 4-6 are the UTF-8 encoded bytes of the string (46 6F 6F).</p>

<p>Now let's add a second member with an integer value:</p>

<pre>
class Message2
{
    string Name = "Foo";
    int Score = 100;
}
</pre>

<p>This message could be encoded as the following bytes:</p>

<pre>
7B 01 03 46 6F 6F <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">02 <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">01 64</span></span> 7D
</pre>

<p>The 7th byte (02) is the new member key (2) encoded as a variable-length integer.</p>

<p>The 8th byte (01) is the length of the integer member value to follow (1 byte), also encoded as a variable-length integer.</p>

<p>And finally, the 9th byte (64) is the base-256 encoded value 100.</p>

<p>Now let's say that we want an array of scores:</p>

<pre>
class Message3
{
    string Name = "Foo";
    int[] Scores = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
}
</pre>

<p>This message could be encoded as the following bytes:</p>

<pre>
7B 01 03 46 6F 6F <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">03 5B <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">01 01 01 02 01 03</span> 5D</span> 7D
</pre>

<p>The 7th byte (03) is the new member key (3) encoded as a variable-length integer.</p>

<p><em>Note that we chose 3 as the member key so as not to conflict with the definition of 
the previous Message2 class and possibly break backward compatibility.</em></p>

<p>The 9th and 16th bytes (5B ... 5D) are the brackets [ ] that surround every array.</p>

<p>Bytes 10-15 are the values in the array, each of which is the length of the encoded value 
(encoded as a variable-length integer) followed by the integer value (encoded as base 256).</p>

<h2>ABNF</h2>
<pre>
object = "{" members "}" / "{}" / null
members = pair / pair members
pair = key value
key = varint ; > 0
array = "[" elements "]" / "[]" / null
elements = value / value elements
value = binary / string / integer / float / object / array / true / false / null
-----
binary = length octets
length = varint ; >= 0
string = length utf-8 ; length is utf-8 octet count
integer = length base-256 ; big endian
float = length ieee-754 ; big endian
true = "t"
false = "f"
null = "~"
varint = variable-length-integer ; Big-endian variable-length quantity, continuation bit in MSB of each octet, sign in bit 6 of first octet
